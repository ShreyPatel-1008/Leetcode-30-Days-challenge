🧩 30 Days of DSA — Learning & Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my 30-Day Data Structures & Algorithms Journey!
This repository documents my daily progress as I solve DSA problems from LeetCode and other platforms to strengthen my foundations, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare for future placements and internships.

🚀 Why This Journey?

Mastering DSA isn’t just about coding — it builds a strong logical mindset, boosts confidence during interviews, and makes you a more efficient developer.
This repo helps me:

Stay consistent
Understand concepts deeply
Track progress over 30 days
Share learning publicly
Build a strong habit of daily problem solving

🧠 What I’m Solving

I aim to cover a wide range of topics throughout the 30 days:

Arrays
Strings
Hashing
Two Pointers
Sliding Window
Recursion
Linked Lists

📈 My Goals

Become confident with core DSA concepts
Improve problem-solving speed
Strengthen coding fundamentals
Prepare for technical interviews
Build consistency through daily practice

🛠️ Tech Stack

C++ (primary)
JavaScript (optional solutions for practice)
Platform: LeetCode / HackerRank

🗂️ Daily Progress
